    "# Realized GARCH Model (Hansen et al., 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Realized GARCH** model provides a flexible and rich representation for modeling returns and realized measures of volatility, as proposed by Hansen et al. (2012). This model explicitly relates the observed realized measure to the latent volatility using a measurement equation, while allowing for asymmetric reactions to shocks.\n",
